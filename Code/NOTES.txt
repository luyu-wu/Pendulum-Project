Exponential Fit not being correct is fine

Define a few damping forces

proportional to v, v^2, sgn(v) (turbulent, viscous, and couloumb/dry)



MUST TEST Prediction that Q-factor is constant with angle. 


QUESTION: Does showing that the log(theta) is not linear show that Q is not constant


MUST CHANGE: Add error bars by bunching up data
